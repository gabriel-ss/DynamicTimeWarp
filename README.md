# Dynamic Time Warp

This is a simple and flexible implementation of the DTW in Julia. It can be installed by issuing the following command in the Julia pkg REPL:

```julia
(v1.0) pkg> add "https://github.com/gabriel-ss/DynamicTimeWarp.jl.git"
```

A description about the DTW algorithm can be founded in [here](https://github.com/gabriel-ss/DynamicTimeWarp.jl/blob/master/docs/algorithm.ipynb).
